Channels\n  containing copies of the channel can be created with 'tap', and\n  detached with 'untap'.\n\n  Each item is distributed to all taps in parallel and synchronously,\n  i.e. each tap must accept before the next item is distributed. Use\n  buffering/windowing to prevent slow taps from holding up the mult.\n\n  Items received when there are no taps get dropped.\n\n  If a tap puts to a closed channel, it will be removed from the mult."],"~$mapcat<",["^ ","^1D",null,"^Y",["^ ","^Z","/home/porky/mecca-paint/resources/public/cljs-out/dev/cljs/core/async.cljs","^[",849,"^10",7,"^11",849,"^12",14,"^1E",["^16",["^1F",["^16",[["~$f","^2P"],["~$f","^2P","^32"]]]]],"^13","Deprecated - this function will be removed.
