# mecca-paint

A [re-frame](https://github.com/day8/re-frame) application for producing, converting and editing SVG images and animated pixel art.

This repo was formed from a collection of techniques I developed while working on the graphical elements of the [MECCA Platform](https://github.com/porkostomus/mecca) and [Mario Music Composer](https://github.com/porkostomus/mario-music-composer).

## Development Mode

### Run application:

```
lein clean
lein dev
```

shadow-cljs will automatically push cljs changes to the browser.

Wait a bit, then browse to [http://localhost:8280](http://localhost:8280).

## Production Build
